        <h2>Elements</h2>

        <p>
            An HTML element is a type of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) document component, one of several types of HTML nodes (there are also text nodes, comment nodes and others).
            The first used version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993 and there have since been many versions of HTML. 
            The current de facto standard is governed by the industry group WHATWG and is known as the HTML Living Standard.

        <p>
            An HTML document is composed of a tree of simple HTML nodes, such as text nodes, and HTML elements, which add semantics and formatting to parts of document 
            (e.g., make text bold, organize it into paragraphs, lists and tables, or embed hyperlinks and images).
            Each element can have HTML attributes specified. Elements can also have content, including other elements and text.

            As HTML (before HTML5) is based on SGML,[2] its parsing also depends on the Document Type Definition (DTD), specifically an HTML DTD (e.g. HTML 4.01[3][note 1]).
            The DTD specifies which element types are possible (i.e. it defines the set of element types) and also the valid combinations in which they may appear in a document.
            It is part of general SGML behavior that, where only one valid structure is possible (per the DTD), its explicit statement in any given document is not generally required. As a simple example, the  tag indicating the start of a paragraph element should be complemented by a tag indicating its end.
            But since the DTD states that paragraph elements cannot be nested, an HTML document fragment Para 1 Para 2 Para 3 is thus inferred to be equivalent to Para 1 Para 2 Para 3. 
            (If one paragraph element cannot contain another, any currently open paragraph must be closed before starting another.) Because this implication is based on the combination of the DTD and the individual document,
            it is not usually possible to infer elements from document tags alone but only by using an SGML—or HTML—aware parser with knowledge of the DTD.
            HTML5 creates a similar result by defining what tags can be omitted.[4]
